# Airline Fares Prediction
This project explores airfare pricing dynamics in India and builds predictive models for flight fares using a large dataset of 452,000+ flights from the country’s seven busiest airports. The dataset was enriched with additional features such as monthly average kerosene prices to capture key cost drivers.

We applied linear regression, ANOVA testing, and LASSO regularization to evaluate the influence of variables like booking window, travel class, flight duration, number of stops, and airline. The models achieved an R² of ~0.85, highlighting strong predictive performance.

Technologies used: R, Python (BeautifulSoup, Selenium), statistical modeling, cross-validation.
